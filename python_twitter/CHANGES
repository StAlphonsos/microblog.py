   tests: add .info() method to objects returned by our Mockup handler
   This is required to completely mimick urllib, and have successful
   response.headers attribute accesses.

 Applied partial patch for Issue 113 
 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=113

   The partial bit means we changed the parameter from "page" to "cursor"
   so the call would work.  What was left out was a more direct way
   to return the cursor value *after* the call and also in the patch
   they also changed the method to return an iterator.

 Issue 50 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=50

 the Rate Limit Status and also adds the new method MaximumHitFrequency

 Multiple typo, indent and whitespace tweaks

 Issue 60 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=60
 Pulled out new GetFavorites and GetMentions methods from the patch
 submitted by joegermuska

 Issue 62 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=62
 Applied patch from lukev123 that adds gzip compression to the GET
 requests sent to Twitter. The patch was modified to default gzip to
 False and to allow the twitter.API class instantiation to set the
 value to True.  This was done to not change current default
 behaviour radically.

 Issue 80 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=80
 Fixed PostUpdate() call example in the README

 Issue 19 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=19
 TinyURL example and the idea for this comes from a bug filed by
 acolorado with patch provided by ghills.

 Issue 37 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=37
 Added base_url to the twitter.API class init call to allow the user
 to override the default https://twitter.com base.  Since Twitter now
 supports https for all calls I (bear) changed the patch to default to
 https instead of http.
 Original issue by kotecha.ravi, patch by wiennat and with implementation
 tweaks by bear.

 Issue 45 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=45
